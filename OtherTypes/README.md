# Test files

This directory has all the different possibilities where prototype is tried to build of from.
Neither is good working version as the index.html from the main page.

## grocery2_0_AFRAME
To get a visual prototype the framework Aframe is tried out. This is a good framework to get a visual and working prototype as unity based, but in gotten timestack this was not the correct type to build the prototype with.

## Grocery_dawio
The prototype before current prototype. This prototype was good to get a sense of visual representation, but could not keep track of products that where chosen. This is build with Draw.io.

## index_future
As the current prototype is only 1 of multiple little games this is a very simple build (only links) where you can choose between the prototypes.
