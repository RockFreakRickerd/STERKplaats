## Grocery shopping (dutch)
The grocery shopping is working as followed:
- You get a list of 9 items that you will need to remember. You will get 30 seconds for it, but you can start sooner if you feel like it.
- You'll be dropped into the grocery itself and you will need to get those products (you get 3 minutes for this).
- If you think you're done you can go to the checkout (kassa).
- When finished you'll get the results of:
   * Which products you've picked.
   * Which (if any) products from those where correctly picked.
   * Which (if any) where extra products.
   * Which (if any) you missed.
   * How many time (if stopped earlier) you still had left.
